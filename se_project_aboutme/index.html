              <p class="card__description">One of the most important aspects of my life is my family—my wife and daughter. My wife and I met nearly a decade ago in Madison, WI. Since then, we have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles together, creating countless memories along the way. Nearly two years ago, our daughter was born, bringing immense joy and fulfillment into our lives. She is one of the best things that has ever happened to us.</p>

            <h2 class="card__title">Travel</h2>
              <p class="card__description">Traveling throughout the world has been a profound and enriching experience for me. Exploring diverse landscapes, from the rugged mountains to the coastlines, has fueled my sense of adventure and curiosity. Each journey has introduced me to unique cultures, histories, and communities, deepening my appreciation for the vastness and beauty of this world. I tend to spontaneously choose a direction and keep an open mind to the experiences that lie ahead.</p>

              <p class="card__description">Creativity has always been a passion of mine, guiding me from design drafts to final implementation. This passion has been a cornerstone in many of my creative pursuits. I’ve been a musician, videographer, painter, graphic designer, and video editor. In recent years, I’ve channeled my creative energy into founding No Coast Van Co., a van and bus conversion company.</p>

              <p class="card__description">Since 2018, I have been an active member of the nomadic and van building communities, in part thanks to the community I've grown through YouTube and the community through Instagram as well. The friendships I've formed within these groups are among the easiest and deepest connections I've ever experienced. This community holds a special place in my heart and means the world to me.</p>
